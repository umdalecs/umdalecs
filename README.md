## Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I am Alejandro

I enjoy backend development and sometimes breaking code. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering.

I'm focused on becoming a professional Go backend developer, building APIs and microservices.

While I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an expert, I‚Äôm comfortable working with Java, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Docker, .NET, and MS SQL.

I‚Äôve explored technologies like Go, Angular, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Rust, PHP, and Node.js at a beginner level.

I'm a Linux user who enjoys testing different distros and breaking my system as I learn new things.
